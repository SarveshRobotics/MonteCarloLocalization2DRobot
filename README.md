# Monte Carlo Localization in Action
Observed the `MCL` in action through the generated images. 

### Compiling the Program
```sh
$ cd /home/workspace/
$ rm -rf Images/*
$ g++ main.cpp -o app -std=c++11 -I/usr/include/python2.7 -lpython2.7
```

### Running the Program
Before you run the program, make sure the `Images` folder is empty!
```sh

Wait for the program to iterate `50` times.
